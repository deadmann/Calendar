# Calendar

Well there was time i though, hey all calendar are comming from JQuery, and why shouldn't we have a good customizable, all calendar supporting calendar?
So i came start a project, gathering formula for calculating base stuff, so there was time i got stuck somehow, so a lot of time it take till someone else came to my help,
but it was late, and i got involved with my own work even more, so i left the scene, ... today i though it may be required by someone, someone may search for it, or someone may want to continoue my path,
Any way, i have JS interface for date, and a class that implement persian calendar, and it's incomplete, but all important function and formula are gathered here.
